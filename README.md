# tscircuit - React for Circuits

Make electronics using Typescript, React, and AI tools.

tscircuit makes developing electronics like web development. Edit code in your favorite IDE and watch the changes
create electronics in realtime. When you're done, [export your project and manufacture](https://docs.tscircuit.com/guides/understanding-fabrication-files)!

Get started by running `npm install -g @tscircuit/cli`! [(CLI quickstart doc)](https://docs.tscircuit.com/intro/quickstart-cli)

## What is tscircuit?

`tscircuit` is a library complemented by a registry, package manager, command line tool and AI electronic design suite that makes it easy to create, share, export and manufacture electronic circuits. It uses
[React Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) to render circuits into web pages.

Think of tscircuit as "React for Electronics" It allows you to design real-world electronic circuits using Typescript and React. This is what tscircuit code looks like, instead of creating web element like “div”, you create circuit elements like “chip”, “resistor” or “capacitor”, then instead of rendering a website, we render a 3d circuit (that you can actually order!)

Using tscircuit, you can design things like a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.tscircuit.com/p/battling-jlcs-assembly-interface" target="_blank">fully functional keyboard!</a> Once you've completed your design, you can export it to a manufacturer and order a real, functional circuit board!

## Example Circuits

- [ESP32 Wifi Breakout Board](https://tscircuit.com/seveibar/wifi-test-board-1)

```tsx
const Circuit = () => (
  <board width="50mm" height="50mm" center_x={0} center_y={0}>
    <MySubcomponent name="U1" center={[0, 0]} footprint="sot236" />
    <resistor
      x={2}
      y={-0.5}
      name="R1"
      resistance="10ohm"
      footprint="0805"
      pcb_x="4mm"
      pcb_y="-1mm"
    />
    <ground x={3} y={1} name="GND" />
    <trace path={[".U1 > .D0", ".R1 > .left"]} />
    <trace path={[".R1 > .right", ".GND > .gnd"]} />
  </board>
)
```

### Wire Color Examples

You can now explicitly control wire/trace colors for clarity in both schematics and PCBs.

Basic trace with a color:

```tsx
<Trace from="r1.left" to="r2.right" color="#ff0000" />
```

Separate colors for schematic and PCB:

```tsx
<Trace
  from="r1.left"
  to="r2.right"
  schematicColor="#00ff00" // Green on schematic
  pcbColor="#0000ff"        // Blue on PCB
/>
```

Schematic line with a color:

```tsx
<SchematicLine x1="0mm" y1="0mm" x2="10mm" y2="0mm" color="#ff00ff" />
```

## Getting Started

You can do everything you need to do with `tscircuit` using the [`tsci`](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli) command line tool.

```bash
npm install -g tscircuit

tsci dev
```

> Open your browser to http://localhost:3020!

## FAQ

### Is tscircuit free?

tscircuit is completely free and MIT-licensed open-source

### How does this work?

tscircuit uses the same thing that React Native and [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) use to render to mobile or 3d to render PCBs and schematics (it's called [React Fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)!)

You can render schematics or PCBs in any React project like this:

```tsx
import { Schematic } from "@tscircuit/schematic-viewer"

export const MyApp = () => (
  <div>Regular web react here!</div>
  <Schematic>
   <resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" />
  </Schematic>
)
```

tscircuit has a bunch of extra tools and exports in the command line, so it's a bit easier to use `tsci dev` to develop circuits (you can always publish and import them later)

### Can I test this in my browser?

Yes! There is a [playground tool!](https://tscircuit.com/editor)

### Do I have to specify the position of every component?

Currently you should specify `pcbX`/`pcbY` for components (and nest inside `<group />`s for convenience!)

We are working on building the equivalent of "flex" and "CSS Grid" autolayout algorithms
for PCBs. Wherever an automatic placement is made, you'll be able to override it.

### Is the auto-routing good?

We are working towards a state-of-the-art web-based autorouting algorithm. You can follow the
progress of our autorouter development on [autorouting.com](https://blog.autorouting.com)

### I found a bug or have an idea for a feature, what should I do?
